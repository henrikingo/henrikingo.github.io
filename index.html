<h1>@henrikingo's github pages</h1>

<p>A couple of my github projects I've published as nice demos:</p>



<ul>
  <li><a href="impress.js/">My fork of impress.js</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Impress.js is a framework for creating cool 3D presentations (not slides!) with HTML5 and CSS3.</li>
    <li>With spiritual guidance from the original creator of this cool software, @bartaz, I've added a plugin api and some new functionality as plugins.</li>
    <li>I also added another <a href="impress.js/examples/classic-slides/">demo presentation</a>. That one actually looks like old fashioned slides.</Äºi>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="presentations/">A repository of real presentations I've done at conferences.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have several <a href="https://github.com/henrikingo?tab=repositories">other projects on github</a> as well. You'll have to check out their README and source code, they don't have nice project pages.</p>
